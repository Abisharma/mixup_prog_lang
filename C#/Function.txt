In programming language instead of repeating the number of lines of code we use functions/methods, functions is used to execute the block of code.
It has certain property to specify that are 
	1. Function_Name :- it is an unique name that is used to call the function.
	2. Parameters :- a function contains number of parameters that are going to be used by it during the execution of block of code, a function that doesn't 
	contain parameter is also known as non-parameterized function.
	3.Access Specifiers :- Access modifiers makes the function acessable within the certain space depending on the access modifiers.
	4.return type :- A function returns the values must specifies the return type of the returning value during the definition of function.
	5.Function body :- function body contains the block of code that is going to execute by the function.


1. Function that returns nothing or returns void and non-parametrized.
using System;

public class FunctionEx{

//Function that return void
void display(){
	Console.WriteLine("this function is returning void ");
    }


public static void Main(String[] args){
		FunctionEx fe = new FunctionEx();
        
        // function calling statement
        fe.display();
        
        }
}


2. Function that return void with parameters.
