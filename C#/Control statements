This file contains examples of control statements that we use in c-sharp programming language to control the flow of program execution.

1. Simple if example :- basically if control statement is used to control the flow of execution of the program, the execution of code depends on the conditioin that
we specified into the if block.

using System;

namespace working_with_online_editor{

public class First_If_Example{

public static void Main(String[] args){

int num = 10;

if(num%2 == 0){
Console.WriteLine("the number is even");
}

}

}

}
