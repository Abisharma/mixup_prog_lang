Object and class :- In c# a program is written by using the object and 
class, object is a real word entity created on run time during the execution
of a program. new keyword is used to allocate the memory for reference
variable of class type i.e. also known as actual object. methods and 
data members are also accessed by using the object.
Class is used to create the group of similer type of object, it is a template
from which objects are created. it can contain fields, methods,
contructors etc.


1.Simple program of an object.

using System;
class ClassAndObjectEx{
    
    //this program contains the simple accessability of the object for data members.
    
    String firstname;
    String lastname;
    
    public static void Main(String[] args){
        
        ClassAndObjectEx caoe = new ClassAndObjectEx();
        caoe.firstname = "alpha";
        caoe.lastname ="con";
    
        Console.WriteLine("the full name is  --" + caoe.firstname + " "+ caoe.lastname);
        
        
        
    }
}

2. Program to contain the Main method into another class.

using System;

public class WithoutMain{
    
   public String first_name;
   public String last_name;
    
    public void display(){
        Console.WriteLine("first name of the student is  "+ first_name + " last name of the student is  "+ last_name);
        
    }
    
}
class ContainMainMethod{
    
    public static void Main(String[] args){
    
    WithoutMain wm  = new WithoutMain();
    wm.first_name = Console.ReadLine();
    wm.last_name = Console.ReadLine();
    
    wm.display();
    }
    
}

3. Program to get input from the user and insert to the data member of the no main method class,

using System;

public class WithoutMain{
    public int student_id;
    public string first_name;
    public string last_name;
    
    
    public void insertion(int id, string fname, string lname){
        
        student_id = id;
        first_name = fname;
        last_name = lname;
        
    }
    
    public void display(){
        Console.WriteLine("student id is" + student_id + "first name of student  is  " + first_name + "last name of student is  "+ last_name );
    }
}

class WithMain{
    
    public static void Main(String[] args){
        
        WithoutMain wm = new WithoutMain();
        int id  = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        String first_name = Console.ReadLine();
        String last_name = Console.ReadLine();
        wm.insertion(id,first_name,last_name);
        wm.display();
    }
    
}
