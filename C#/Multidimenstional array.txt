Multi dimenstional array is used to stored the data in the form of matrix, that is consist of row and column(tabular form). to declare the multidimenstional array we 
need to specify the comma operator inside the square brackets as below;

// example of 2D array
int[,] array_two_Dimenstional = new int[3,3];
int[,] array_two_Dimenstional = new int[,]{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};
int[,] array_Two_Dimenstional = new int[]{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};
